Case study 1: Image classification using CNN based model trained usinf CIFAR10 dataset, where 'Aeroplane', 'Car', 'Bird' images are classified by the trained model.
Case study 2: Traversing through image augmentation techniques and their implementation, and creating a CNN based model for classification of CIFAR10 test data.
Case study 3: Deep CNN based model creation to classify 43 different traffic signs.
