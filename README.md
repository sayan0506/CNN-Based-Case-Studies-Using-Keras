* **Case study 1:** Image classification using CNN based model trained usinf CIFAR10 dataset, where 'Aeroplane', 'Car', 'Bird' images are classified by the trained model. The detailed implementation can be found in the python notebook [code](https://github.com/sayan0506/CNN-based-Case-Studies-using-Keras/blob/master/Image_Classification_with_CNNs_using_Keras_on_CIFAR10.ipynb).

* **Case study 2:** Traversing through image augmentation techniques and their implementation, and creating a CNN based model for classification of CIFAR10 test data. The detailed implementation can be found in the python notebook [code](https://github.com/sayan0506/CNN-based-Case-Studies-using-Keras/blob/master/Image_Data_Augmentation_with_Keras_Complete.ipynb). 

* **Case study 3:** Deep CNN based model creation to classify 43 different traffic signs. The detailed implementation can be found in the python notebook [code](https://github.com/sayan0506/CNN-based-Case-Studies-using-Keras/blob/master/Deep_Learning_For_Traffic_Sign_Classification.ipynb). Traffic sign datasets can be found from the drive link mentioned in the [doc](https://github.com/sayan0506/CNN-Based-Case-Studies-Using-Keras/tree/master/Datasets/Traffic_signs%20dataset).

The trained model information including the trained weights and other parameters file can be found from [Weights](https://github.com/sayan0506/CNN-Based-Case-Studies-Using-Keras/tree/master/Weights).
