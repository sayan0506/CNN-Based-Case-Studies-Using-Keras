* **Case study 1:** Image classification using CNN based model trained usinf CIFAR10 dataset, where 'Aeroplane', 'Car', 'Bird' images are classified by the trained model. The detailed implementation can be found in the python notebook [code](https://github.com/sayan0506/CNN-based-Case-Studies-using-Keras/blob/master/Image_Classification_with_CNNs_using_Keras_on_CIFAR10.ipynb).
* **Case study 2:** Traversing through image augmentation techniques and their implementation, and creating a CNN based model for classification of CIFAR10 test data.
* **Case study 3:** Deep CNN based model creation to classify 43 different traffic signs.
